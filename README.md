# Expense_Record
Juan and Maria keep an expense record individually, but since they are living together and share expenses they want to know where the money is going on, and how the common expenses are being distributed. The main idea is doing some exploratory analysis to answer these questions.

This Project is composed of 4 files "Registro_Contable_Juan" and "Registro_Contable_Maria" are 2 excel files with the raw data, "Record" is an excel with the cleaned data, and "Registro Contable" is an ipynb file with all the code.
