# Expense_Record
The objective of this project was to take two records of a couple's expenses to evaluate them together, identify how common expenses are being distributed and observe their evolution over time. For this, a thorough cleaning of the data and unification of criteria were first required.

This Project is composed of 4 files "Registro_Contable_Juan" and "Registro_Contable_Maria" are 2 excel files with the raw data, "Record" is an excel with the cleaned data, and "Registro Contable" is an ipynb file with all the code.
